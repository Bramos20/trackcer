## About TrackCer

TrackCer is a producer-centric music platform that fills the gap in streaming services by highlighting the creators behind the tracks. By integrating data from Spotify, Apple Music, Discogs, and Genius, we provide comprehensive producer statistics, rankings, and insights. Our platform enables users to discover music through producer profiles, create producer-based playlists, and explore connections between producers based on their collaborations. TrackCer transforms how listeners understand music by revealing the often-overlooked influence producers have across artists and genres. Through our multiple API integrations, users gain access to rich producer data regardless of their preferred streaming service, making music discovery more meaningful and complete.
